Employees will be evaluated for profit-sharing from the **Employee Profit Pool (20%)** based on transparent criteria such as:

- Performance and goal achievement  
- Seniority and experience  
- Role criticality and contribution  
- Attendance and reliability  

Profit shares from the Employee Profit Pool will be allocated proportionally based on evaluation scores. The Initial Employee Fixed Share (10%) is distributed equally among eligible employees.

### Point-Based Performance System Example

| Criteria             | Max Points | Description                                   |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Performance          | 40         | Achievement of goals, quality of work, KPIs   |
| Experience & Seniority | 20         | Years with company, relevant skills           |
| Role & Contribution   | 25         | Impact, leadership, teamwork, initiative      |
| Attendance & Reliability | 15         | Punctuality, presence, dependability          |
| **Total**             | **100**    |                                               |

Each employee receives scores on each criterion, summed to calculate a total out of 100. Profit share is proportional to the employee’s total points relative to all participating employees.
